# PRACTICE 4: THE SPLENDOR OF AUTUMN IN KOREA
Hidden away in quiet corners are reminders of Korea’s ancient past

Every nation boasts a best season. But there is hardly any better sight than an autumn in Korea.

From September till late November, the air is crisp and fresh, but the sun remains toasty warm. Korea's fall foliage spills down densely forested hillsides in a riot of wondrous color. Set against the cobalt blue of a Korean sky, the brilliant reds of maples, and the radiant golds of ginkgo trees, are almost painfully beautiful.

The sprawling city of Seoul, home to 12 million, is both one of Asia's oldest cities and one of its newest.  The capital can be physically striking, especially in early autumn, when the northern air is cool and clear, and the craggy mountains north of the city are already dusted with the season’s first snowfall. 

Modern expressways, brimming with new Korean-made cars, are reflected in new glass-and-steel skyscrapers. Yet hidden away in quiet corners are reminders of Korean’s ancient past, a feast of 16th -century buildings and carefully preserved palaces, set back behind streets lined with stately ginkgo trees in gorgeous golden autumn hues.

Seoul boasts many fine hotels, including a Westin, a Hyatt and a Hilton. But the nation’s premier accommodation is the Hotel Shilla. Set in the midst of its own 23-acre garden, as Korea’s de facto state guest house, the Shilla beautifully blends Korea’s honored ancient roots with state-of-the art technology. No wonder the Shilla has hosted such VIPs as Nelson Mandela and Boris Yeltsin.

But to discover the true heart of old Korea, you must venture beyond Seoul to the country’s rural villages and its national parks. Aside from getting to Korea, the nation’s flag carrier, Korean Air, which is also one of Asia’s largest airlines, can carry you quickly and conveniently to virtually any point in Korea within an hour. 

Hong Eun-mee, a director with the Korean National Tourist Corporation, says her favorite places in Korea are the traditional temples.

“Many Korean temples are built in the mountains, and our mountains are exuberant with various greens, so there is always a sweet fragrance in the forest. The mountain trails leading to these temples are usually shadowed with thick trees, which turn gorgeous red and yellow tints during autumn. I like the tranquility and sanctity of these temples. There’s a perfect that I sometimes feel I’ve gone back hundreds of years. I especially recommend Toson - sa Temple, near Seoul’s Pukan-san National Park.”

Chris Park, Hyatt International’s marketing director, in Seoul, prefers to explore further afield, something easy to do on Korea’s superb road network. “I recommend visiting the rugged west coast, especially during the fall months. Following National Road #36, you can drive north from Kyongju along the lovely coastline. This is where one encounters some of Korea’s best natural beauty – scenic mountains, deep valleys and quaint country towns during harvest time. The roads are excellent and there are simple Korean restaurants to stop for lunch. In 10 hours you’ll see a complete range of scenery.”

For the serious culture vultures, there is Kyongju, often compared to Kyoto. Here are buried the kings of the fabled Shilla Dynasty, Who ruled Korea 2,000 years ago and carried the nation to glorious heights. Today the ruins of the dynasty can still be seen, including dozens of temples, palace ruins and royal tombs; this awesome open-air museum has been designated by UNESCO as one of the world’s 10 most important cultural sites.

Last but not least, 60 miles off the south coast is verdant Cheju. Resembling Ireland in its gentle green beauty, Cheju has good hotels and a reputation for the freshest seafood, which have made it the nation’s honeymoon capital. Either Cheju or Kyongju is just an hour’s flight from Seoul aboard Korean Air or Asiana, which offer hourly flights.
